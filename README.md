# employee-tracker

In this project I am learning MySQL to manipulate database tables by asking questions through npm inquirer.

The project is organizing a business owner's employee data including employee roles, titles, managers and much more.

# User Story

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

# Running the Application
The application uses the following options and will manipulate the MySQL database based on which option has been chosen.

Employee Tracker Options
View all Departments
View all Roles
View all Employees
View employees by department
Add a department
Add a role
Add an employee
Update an employee
Delete an employee - bonus
Quit

I used a connection.js and an index.js file to link to my server.js which allowed for cleaner code since these options required quite a lot of lines of code.
