# employee-tracker

In this project I am learning MySQL to manipulate database tables by asking questions through npm inquirer.

The project is organizing a business owner's employee data including employee roles, titles, managers and much more.

SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

The application uses the following options and will manipulate the MySQL database based on which option has been chosen.

I used a connection.js and an index.js file to link to my server.js which allowed for cleaner code since these options required quite a lot of lines of code.
